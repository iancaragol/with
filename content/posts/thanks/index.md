This is a big trip, the biggest I have ever taken, and a lot has gone into the preparation. I wanted to thank the following people who really helped me out!

#### [LOAM Equipment](https://www.loamequip.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoohWVhOaIyDiKnzwUVjXO2Rb1Npd3M553weuoMPmh6BbzpjbHM5)
##### Bellingham, WA

I first met Rachel and Alan at the Northwest Tuneup where we discussed one of my favorite things - bike bags! I spent a while admiring their clean stitches (much better than my own) and sharing my own forays into bag making. Especially the wet suit zipper, the ultimate bikepacking zipper.

When I decided to upgrade my Trek 920 instead of building a new bike, I knew just who to reach out for for the PERFECT Paddingtont themed framebag. Rachel and Alan went above and beyond. The bag is perfect, with clean lines, extra burly zippers, and direct mounting.

Thank you Rachel and Alan!

#### [Wheels Bike Shop](https://www.steamboatwheels.com/)
##### Steamboat Springs, CO

Before any big event (this one being my biggest) I always run into Wheels in a flurry. At least 3 times.

In preparing for my trip to Japan, I rebuilt the Trek 920 from scratch with all new components (except the Headset). This was my first time putting a bike together, so I took it to Wheels for a safety check.

Over the next few weeks I dialed in the bike with help from Cole, who took the time to make sure my bike was ready to go.

Thank you Cole!

#### [Alchemy Body and Bike]()
##### Steamboat Springs, CO

I changed a lot of things on my bike, new handlebars, stem, saddle, seatpost... I was in desperate need of a bike fit, but did not plan ahead and make an appointment!

Luckily Raymond at Alchemy Body and Bike was able to get me in for an emergency fitting, and now I am dialed in and ready to ride!

Thank you Raymond!

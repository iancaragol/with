Dear Aunt Lucy,

This past week I rafted the Gates of Ladore. The river was Green, like back home, but the similarities ended there.

Instead of trees and greenery, I was surrounded by towering walls of sandstone.  Red and magnificent. I found that them only slightly more difficult to climb. The local bears are a solitary bunch. I did not see any, but Wolf did tell some stories.

The rafters are some of the more unique humans I have met. They wear wild colors and a flotation vest at all times, even when on shore! They operate as one group, preparing meals, doing dishes, and scouting rapids.

Each boat has two to three of these rafters on it. They are truly quite large, one called a “Catamaran” was 16 feet long! They are aided by the current and only row hard when the wind blows.

… to be continued!
